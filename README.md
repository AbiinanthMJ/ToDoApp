# ✅ Expo To-Do App

A task management mobile application built with **React Native (Expo)** that allows users to organize their daily activities.  
The app focuses on simplicity while demonstrating integration with backend APIs and database storage.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of a learning experience to understand **full-stack mobile app development**.  
The main goal was to build a **To-Do application** where users can:  
- Create, update, and delete tasks  
- Store tasks in a database  
- View tasks with a clean and simple UI  

We aimed to also implement authentication and additional features but faced limitations during development.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React Native (Expo framework)  
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js  
- **Database:** MongoDB (cloud-hosted)  
- **State Management:** React hooks  
- **Authentication (Planned):** Google OAuth – *not completed*  

---

## ✨ Features Implemented
- ✅ Add, edit, and delete tasks  
- ✅ Persistent storage using MongoDB  
- ✅ Simple and user-friendly UI with Expo components  
- ✅ Fully functional core features as per requirements  

---

## 🚧 Features Not Implemented
- ❌ **Google OAuth login** – not implemented due to lack of experience with OAuth flows.  
- ❌ **Menu and Due Date functionality** – not implemented because of time constraints.  

✔️ Other than the above, all required features have been successfully implemented.

---

## 🚀 Attempted Implementations
During development, we also explored:  
- Setting up **API endpoints** with Express.js for CRUD operations  
- Using **JWT authentication** (partially tested but not finalized)  
- Preparing the app for **APK builds** to be shared outside Expo Go
