# ✅ Expo To-Do App

A task management mobile application built with **React Native (Expo)** that allows users to organize their daily activities.  
The app focuses on simplicity and local state management to handle task operations without requiring a backend or external database.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of a learning experience to understand **mobile app development using React Native (Expo)**.  
The main goal was to build a **To-Do application** where users can:  
- Create, update, and delete tasks  
- Store tasks locally during app usage  
- View tasks with a clean and simple UI  

We initially planned to integrate authentication and cloud storage but decided to keep the project simple due to time and experience constraints.
